On February 10th and 11th, Liangliang and his group participated in a two-day microbiome workshop hosted by the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center. During the poster session, our team showcased several innovative projects. Ruitao presented a comprehensive review of different phylogenetic tree construction methods for both 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing data, discussing their respective advantages and limitations. Chenyu presented his investigation on the relationship between the gut microbiome and Alzheimer’s disease, titled “APOE4-Linked Gut Microbiome Alterations and Alzheimer’s Risk via the Gut-Brain Axis,” which highlighted novel insights into the gut-brain connection. Additionally, Yiqan illustrated his work reviewing transformation methods for microbiome data, focusing on their impact on downstream analyses. The workshop provided an excellent platform for interdisciplinary discussion and collaboration, enhancing our collective understanding of microbiome research.
