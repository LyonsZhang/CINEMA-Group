### Description

Date: Feb 2023

Title: Research Associate STS (Specialized Technical Skills)

Department: Population and Quantitative Health Sciences

School: Medicine

Location: Case Western Reserve University

Supervisor Name and Title: Ming Wang, Associate Professor

POSITION OBJECTIVE

The Clinical Application and STatistical LEarning (CASTLE) Lab focuses on statistical method development and collaborative work in biomedical and human health research. The lab will closely work with interdisciplinary investigators to explore clinically impactful questions in the fields of cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and neurodegenerative disease (e.g., Alzheimer’s’ disease, Parkinson’s disease) by utilizing state-of-art statistical methods and developing tools for clinical practice. The lab is seeking a research associate to assist the PI in all aspects of the execution of lab work and promote research in biostatistics and quantitative healthcare.

 

The Research Associate STS is expected to perform data management and analysis, coordinate the lab activities, oversee collaboration, carry out assigned research projects through completion under the guidance of PI, and work independently with research engagement. The research associate has the opportunities for (PhD and MS-level) student mentoring, (co-authored) paper publications and is also encouraged to conduct methodological research of his/her interest if time allows. Specifically, the research associate will keep the PI informed of progress of research and collaborative projects, present data and findings at lab and scientific meetings, seminars, etc., help on manuscript preparation, and contribute preliminary data for grant proposals. 

 

The research associate should have basic education and training background of statistics, biostatistics, (applied) mathematics, data science, computing science or other quantitative analytical fields. Preference will be given to a highly motivated and skilled candidate with specific expertise in longitudinal data analysis, survival analysis, causal inference, biomarker identification, data integration, risk prediction, big data analysis (e.g., Electronic Health Record, National Cancer Registries) and software package development.

 

The CWRU SOM is affiliated with some of the best hospitals in the United States, such as University Hospitals Case Medical Center (UHCMC), Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF), The Metro Health System (MHS) and Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Through these partnerships, cutting-edge technologies, research facilities and collaborative opportunities are accessible to our research team. The recruited candidate will have chances to work with researchers in the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCCC), Cleveland Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (CADRC) and Cleveland Clinics Foundation (CCF).
