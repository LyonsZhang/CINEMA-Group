Dr. Xuan Cao is a statistician specializing in Bayesian model selection and high-dimensional inference, particularly in the context of graphical models. She earned her Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Florida in 2018, where her dissertation focused on graphical models and nonlocal priors in high-dimensional Bayesian analysis under the guidance of Dr. Kshitij Khare and Dr. Malay Ghosh. She holds a B.S. in Statistics from Nanjing University. Dr. Cao's research interests span Bayesian methodologies, covariance estimation, and statistical applications in neuroscience. She is a recipient of the Simons Foundation Collaboration Grant for Mathematicians (2019â€“2024) and several other honors, including the Bagui Award and the TF-LEaRN Program Scholarship.
