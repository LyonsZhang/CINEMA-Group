Chen Yang is a junior at Southern Medical University majoring in biostatistics. In 2020-2021, he was awarded the National Scholarship from the Ministry of Education of China, an honor only received by 0.2% of China's top students.

Chen is highly skilled in mathematical modeling and has won numerous awards in national competitions. During his freshman year, he worked as a research assistant on a project focused on assessing the quality of grass-roots health through standardized patients, and the results have been successfully implemented.

In the summer of 2022, Chen worked as a research assistant at the Case Western Reserve University Center for Quantitative Medicine, under the supervision of Professor Liangliang Zhang. They developed an R package to process microbiome data and are applying Bayesian statistics in their experiments.

Chen is currently seeking a summer 23 internship and a fall 24 Ph.D. position in biostatistics or a related field. If you have any opportunities available, please feel free to contact him.
