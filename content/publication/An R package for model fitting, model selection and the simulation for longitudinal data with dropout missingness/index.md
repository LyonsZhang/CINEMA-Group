## Abstract

Missing data arise frequently in clinical and epidemiological fields, in particular in longitudinal studies. This paper describes the core features of an R package **wgeesel**, which implements marginal model fitting (i.e., weighted generalized estimating equations, WGEE; doubly robust GEE) for longitudinal data with dropouts under the assumption of missing at random. More importantly, this package comprehensively provide existing information criteria for WGEE model selection on marginal mean or correlation structures. Also, it can serve as a valuable tool for simulating longitudinal data with missing outcomes. Lastly, a real data example and simulations are presented to illustrate and validate our package.

**Keywords:** Dropout missingness; R; generalized estimating equations; inverse probability weight; missing at random; model selection; quasi-likelihood.
