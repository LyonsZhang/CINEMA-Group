## Abstract

**Summary:** In fields, such as ecology, microbiology and genomics, non-Euclidean distances are widely applied to describe pairwise dissimilarity between samples. Given these pairwise distances, principal coordinates analysis is commonly used to construct a visualization of the data. However, confounding covariates can make patterns related to the scientific question of interest difficult to observe. We provide adjusted principal coordinates analysis as an easy-to-use tool, available as both an R package and a Shiny app, to improve data visualization in this context, enabling enhanced presentation of the effects of interest.

**Availability and implementation:** The R package 'aPCoA' and Shiny app can be accessed at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aPCoA/index.html and https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/shinyapps/aPCoA/.
