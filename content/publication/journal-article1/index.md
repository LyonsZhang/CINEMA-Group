abstract: The study compared beta diversity and clustering methods commonly used in microbiome data analysis. No single method consistently outperformed the others, but the Bray Curtis and unweighted UniFrac metrics showed poor performance in certain datasets. The study proposed a novel combined metric of BC and UU that showed high performance across all datasets, demonstrating the benefit of combining metrics.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this study, various beta diversity and clustering methods commonly used in microbiome analysis were systematically compared. No single method was consistently better, but certain methods underperformed in specific scenarios. A combined metric of Bray Curtis and unweighted UniFrac was proposed, tested, and found to perform well across all datasets.
