## ABSTRACT

Modulation of commensal gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a promising strategy to reduce mortality in patients with malignant diseases, but monitoring for dysbiosis is generally not routine clinical practice due to equipment, expertise and funding required for sequencing analysis. A low-threshold alternative is microbial diversity profiling by single-cell flow cytometry (FCM), which we compared to 16S rRNA sequencing in human fecal samples and employed to characterize longitudinal changes in the microbiome composition of patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma undergoing chemoimmunotherapy. Diversity measures obtained from both methods were correlated and captured identical trends in microbial community structures, finding no difference in patientsâ€™ pretreatment alpha or beta diversity compared to healthy controls and a significant and progressive loss of alpha diversity during chemoimmunotherapy. Our results highlight the potential of FCM-based microbiome profiling as a reliable and accessible diagnostic tool that can provide novel insights into cancer therapy-associated dysbiosis dynamics.
