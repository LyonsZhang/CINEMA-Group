title: The HAILO project
summary: In this study, we focus on the primary outcomes of NCI and aim to enhance our understanding and knowledge of it and identify associated potential risk factors including metabolic-related markers or inflammatory factors by leveraging the highly correlated information from secondary outcomes of frailty, falls and disability.

Individuals living with HIV (PWH) encounter a greater occurrence and earlier emergence of age-related health issues compared to the general population. Among these, a significant concern is neurocognitive impairment (NCI), which is more prevalent in PWH than in individuals without HIV (PwoH). The resulting physical and cognitive decline escalates the risk of falls, frailty, and mortality among older PWH. Previous studies, both in PWH and PwoH, have revealed noteworthy connections between frailty and NCI in older individuals. In the HIV Infection, Aging, and Immune Function Long-Term Observation (HAILO) study involving older PWH, it was observed that baseline NCI served as a predictor of subsequent frailty, while the reverse relationship was not apparent.

This study primarily focuses on neurocognitive impairment (NCI) as its main objective, aiming to deepen our understanding and knowledge of this condition. Additionally, it aims to identify potential risk factors associated with NCI, including markers related to metabolism and inflammatory factors. To achieve this, we will utilize the highly correlated information obtained from secondary outcomes such as frailty, falls, and disability. Our approach will involve employing the proposed and published methods capable of handling diverse types of outcomes, including binary data and time-to-event data. We will utilize an empirical likelihood-based weighting framework to conduct an exclusive exploration of the HAILO study.
