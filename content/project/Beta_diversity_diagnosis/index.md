We developed a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving beta diversity measures in microbiome research. Our work highlights the geometric and statistical limitations of widely used dissimilarity measures such as UniFrac, Bray-Curtis, Jaccrad, and introduces diagnostic tools as well as correction methods to enhance their reliability. This framework supports more robust ecological inference. A user-friendly R package is to be available at https://github.com/bioscinema.
