Liangliang and the team rang in the 2025 Independence Day holiday with a festive afternoon at Edgewater Park in Cleveland, Ohio. We wandered the lakeside trails, soaked up the summer sunshine. As dusk settled, we made our way to Lao Szechuan for a celebratory dinnerâ€”sharing peking duck, and all bursting with Szechuan flavors. Dr. Pingfu also joined to have dinner with us! It was the perfect blend of fresh lake air, bold cuisine, and great company to cap off a memorable holiday!
