The Omics group had a fantastic time at the PQHS Department’s annual picnic, held this year at the picturesque Squire Valleevue and Valley Ridge Farms. Under a canopy of verdant trees we gathered around long picnic tables, savoring juicy, flame-grilled burgers and savory sausages fresh off the barbecue. Between bites, we wandered the rolling farm fields, enjoyed gentle hayrides, and laughed over friendly lawn games. Best of all, we caught up with fellow students and faculty—swapping stories, forging new connections, and celebrating the spirit of our community in the warm summer air.
