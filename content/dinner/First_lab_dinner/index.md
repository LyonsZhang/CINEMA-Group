We have our first lab dinner for celebrating 2023 Winter Holiday!

<!--more-->

Liangliang and the team rang in the 2023 winter holiday with a festive gathering at K-POT in Strongsville (2 SouthPark Center, Strongsville, OH 44136). We savored an interactive hot-pot experience, cooking fresh ingredients in rich, simmering broth, and grilled premium cuts of meat Korean-barbecue--style right at our table. It was a wonderful evening of good food, great company, and holiday cheer!
