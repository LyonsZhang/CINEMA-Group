Weighted generalized estimating equations (WGEE) is an extension of generalized linear models to longitudinal clustered data by incorporating the correlation within-cluster when data is missing at random (MAR). The parameters in mean, scale correlation structures are estimated based on quasi-likelihood. Multiple model selection criterion are provided for selection of mean model and working correlation structure based on WGEE/GEE.
